## Publishing Maps

**Wax** is a collection of extras and tools that make it easier to publish 
custom maps on any website. It's an extension of 
[different mapping APIs](#mapping-libraries), but we'll start out with Modest 
Maps.

But first, here's an intro into web maps from the very basics. Assuming that you've 
been designing maps with [TileMill](http://tilemill.com/) or another design tool, and 
have gotten them up on a server for your usage, what's next? It's actually 
quite simple to get to the next step: your basic ingredients are

* A map server, like [TileStream](https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream)
* A Javascript API, like [Modest Maps](https://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js)
* Your website
</p>


<div class='section'>
<p class='md'>
The mapping server serves up **tiles** of rendered data - tiles being 256 pixel 
square images covering some of the world. Here's a tile of Europe from the 
[World Light tileset](http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-light).

There are quite a few mapping APIs, but at their core, they're doing the same 
sort of thing - adding these tiles to a page and managing them so that the 
map seems like a continuous world instead of little squares. We'll start off with 
**Modest Maps** because it's lightweight and fast.
</p>

</p>

<p class='md'>
### Including the Code

The first step is to actually download and include the necessary Javascript 
code to make your map work. We'll also include a CSS file to start rolling with 
style.

After you've got the code downloaded, you'll need to put it on your server and
include it on your page. The include files are segmented by the mapping API you're 
using, so in our case, we'll use Modest Maps - `mm`.

    <script src='build/wax.mm.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script>

Then you'll want to include the theme file so that you can see controls -
you can always swap in your own later on.

    <link href='theme/controls.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' /> 

You'll do the usual Modest Maps setup - just as you'll do the standard setup 
process with the other APIs.
</p>

<div id='modestmaps-setup' class='map'>
<span class='attribution'>
    <a href='http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-light'>World Light</a>
</span>
</div>
<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
// Alias com.modestmaps to mm. This isn't necessary - just
// nice, because it makes the code shorter.
var mm = com.modestmaps;
// Set up a map in a div with the id 'modestmaps-setup'
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-setup',
  // Use Wax's special 'provider' code to add a new custom layer
  new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
    // From the main MapBox server
    baseUrl: 'http://a.tile.mapbox.com/',
    // Called world-light
    layerName: 'world-light'}),
    // And it'll be 448px by 300px
    new mm.Point(448,300));

// Center it on the United States, at zoom level 4.
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>
<p class='md'>
## Wax Extras

Wax provides a set of map controls for Modest Maps that make common map
tricks easier to do.
</p>
<p class='md'>
### Interaction

The interaction control adds quite a bit of logic to the map, adding 
interactivity - mouse hovers and clicks - to layers that support it, like those
made with [TileMill](http://tilemill.com/) and the interactive 
[UTFGrid section] [1]
of the [MBTiles spec] [2].

</p>
<div class='section'>
<div id='modestmaps-interaction' class='map'>
<span class='attribution'>
    <a href='http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/apr/7/i-heart-npr-facebook-app-maps-fans'>Map by NPR</a>
</span>
</div>

<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
var mm = com.modestmaps;
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-interaction',
    new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
      baseUrl: 'http://a.npr.mapbox.com/',
      layerName: 'iheartnpr-0010'}), new mm.Point(448,300))
  .interaction();
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>


<p class='md'>
### Fullscreen

The fullscreen control adds a link to the map that assigns a 
fullscreen class to the map, which makes it fill the page.

You'll see that this control adds a fullscreen link to the map, and that it's 
a bit ugly right now. Until Wax's theming improves, keep in mind that its 
styling, which is contained in `theme/controls.css`, is completely optional 
and you can replace it with your own.
</p>

<div class='section'>
<div id='modestmaps-fullscreen' class='map'>
<span class='attribution'>
    <a href='http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-light'>World Light</a>
</span>
</div>
<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
var mm = com.modestmaps;
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-fullscreen',
    new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
      baseUrl: 'http://a.tile.mapbox.com/',
      layerName: 'world-light'}), new mm.Point(448,300))
  .fullscreen();
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>

<p class='md'>
### Zoomer

The Zoomer control is a stripped-down version of zoom controls, offering just
zoom in & out buttons.
</p>

<div class='section'>
<div id='modestmaps-zoomer' class='map dark'>
<span class='attribution'>
    <a href='http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-glass'>World Glass</a>
</span>
</div>
<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
var mm = com.modestmaps;
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-zoomer',
    new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
      baseUrl: 'http://a.tile.mapbox.com/',
      layerName: 'world-glass'}), new mm.Point(448,300))
  .zoomer();
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>

<p class='md'>
### Legend

The legend control pulls legend information from an interactive layer and 
displays it on the map.
</p>

<div class='section'>
<div id='modestmaps-legend' class='map'>
<span class='attribution'>
    <a href='http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-print'>World Print</a>
</span>
</div>
<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
var mm = com.modestmaps;
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-legend',
    new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
      baseUrl: 'http://a.tile.mapbox.com/',
      layerName: 'world-print'}), new mm.Point(448,300))
  .legend();
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>

<p class='md'>
## Wax Records

Records are a feature of Wax aimed to simplify the configuration of sites that
host many maps. They translate the configuration of any mapping API into 
logic-free [JSON](http://json.org/), where it can be stored in a database and 
easily modified by other code.
</p>
<div class='section'>
<pre class='sh_javascript'>
new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('gmap'), {
  center: new google.maps.LatLng(0, 0),
  zoom: 2,
  mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
});

// The above code is equivalent to

wax.Record({ 'wax':
  ['@new google.maps.Map',
    ['@call document.getElementById', 'gmap'],
    {
      center: ['@new google.maps.LatLng', 0, 0],
      zoom: 2,
      mapTypeId: ['@literal google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP']
    }
  ]
});
</pre>
<p class='md'>
Records aim to be a very close translation from the actual Javascript. 
You'll notice that the Javascript keyword `new` is represented by `@new`, 
and the same with calling functions, using literal functions, etc.

* Records are not written for variable-heavy code. A great chaining interface,
with `@group`, `@inject`, and `@chain` is available for libraries that 
are written in a chainable fashion, like Modest Maps and Polymaps.
* Records are mainly written for code that will be 'done' when the Record 
stops spinning. Although `wax.Record` returns the last object it was playing
around with (most often the map object), this is more a convenience than a core 
API guarantee.
</p>
</div>
<p class='md'>
## Mapping Libraries

Wax supports [Modest Maps] [1], [OpenLayers] [2], and [Google Maps] [3] APIs
with custom map controls - the ability to interact with tooltips and links,
a legend to illustrate map data, and other various utilities.

Modest Maps is the recommended library for use with Wax. Being more compact 
than OpenLayers, faster on older browsers than Polymaps, and more flexible 
than the Google Maps makes it a good choice for custom mapping applications.
The library was originally developed by Tom Carden and Mike Migurski of
[Stamen](http://stamen.com/) as a port of [ActionScript and Python code](http://modestmaps.com/).

### Modest Maps and Layering

Modest Maps natively supports a single map layer at a time, unlike OpenLayers, 
which has a flexible baselayer/overlay system. Currently we're working on 
compositing layers server-side rather than supporting multiple layers in the 
browser, because this could give a much higher level of performance.

The main reason that [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/) is not recommended for
mainstream usage is its lack of support for Internet Explorer. Modest Maps,
OpenLayers, and Google Maps all have solid support for Internet Explorer 7
and higher.

### Protips

For faster maps, use multiple servers. [Most browsers have a limit](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=browser+domain+connection+limit&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=)
for how many things they can ask a single server for at one time - for 
instance, Modest Maps will aim to download 18 tiles as soon as you load a map, 
but Internet Explorer decides that the server shouldn't handle more than two
requests at a time. Thus, only two tiles are downloaded at a time, despite the 
fact that modern servers can handle many more. For this problem, we use multiple 
servers, or more often, multiple domain names. So, you can use

* `a.tile.mapbox.com`
* `b.tile.mapbox.com` and
* `c.tile.mapbox.com`

For tile requests. And you can easily specify them in Modest Maps - just give
the `WaxProvider` function an array of domain names instead of just one.

<div id='modestmaps-cnames' class='map dark'>
<span class='attribution'>
  <a href='http://mapbox.com/tileset/world-glass'>World Glass</a>
</span>
</div>
<pre class='sh_javascript run'>
var mm = com.modestmaps;
var m = new mm.Map('modestmaps-cnames',
    new com.modestmaps.WaxProvider({
      baseUrl: [
        'http://a.tile.mapbox.com/',
        'http://b.tile.mapbox.com/',
        'http://c.tile.mapbox.com/'],
      layerName: 'world-glass'}), new mm.Point(448,300));
m.setCenterZoom(
  new com.modestmaps.Location(38.8225909, -97.5585),
  4);
</pre>
</div>
<div class='section'>
<p class='md'>
And, of course, there are other options you can set on the WaxProvider 
object, not just layerName and baseUrl.

* **filetype**: default `.png`, it can be `.jpg` or anything else.
* **zoomRange**: default `[0, 18]`, it can be any restricted range of 
zoom levels that you happen to have rendered.
